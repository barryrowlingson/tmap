#' Approximate area sizes of the shapes.
#' 
#' This function approximates the area sizes of the polygons either in 1) squared kilometers, 2) absolute numbers based on the polygon coordinates, 3) proportional numbers, 4) normalized numbers.
#' 
#' To approximate the sizes in squared kilometer, \code{total.area.km2} is required. Note that this method is an approximation, since it depends on the used projection and the level of detail of the SpatialPolygons object. Projections with equal-area property are highly recommended.

#' @param shp shape object, i.e. a SpatialPolygons(DataFrame)
#' @param total.area.km2 total area size of \code{shp} in number of squared kilometers. If \code{NA}, and \code{unit="km2"}, then the polygon coordinates are assumed to be in meters.

#' 	\item{\code{"km2"}:}{Squared kilometers. For this method, \code{total.area.km2} is required.}
#' 	\item{\code{"abs"}:}{Absolute numbers based on polygon coordinates. Only usefull if the projection satisfies the equal-area property. Note: these are equal to the \code{area} slots of the polygons, where the \code{area} slots of the holes are subtracted. Also note that for many projections, the coordinate units are meters, so the area sizes correspond to squared meters (rather than squared kilometers).}
