#' Thematic maps are geographical maps in which spatial data distributions are visualized. This package offers a flexible, layer-based, way to create all kinds of thematic maps, such as choropleths and bubble maps.

#' World, Europe and Netherlands map
#' 
#' Maps of the world, Europe and the Netherlands (province and municipality level).
#' 
#' \code{World} World map. The projection that is chosen for this world map is Eckhart IV since area sizes are preserved, which is a very important property for statistical purposes.
#' 
#' \code{Europe} Europe map. Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection is used by default for this map. Several countries are transcontinental and are partly located in Asia. From these countries, only Russia and Turkey have been included in this map as part of Europe since they are widely considered as European countries. Other transcontinental countries Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Kazakhstan, are also included in the map, but only passively. From the other surrounding countries, only Greenland is removed from the map, since it interferes with the map title.
#' 
#' \code{NLD_prov} and \code{NLD_muni}, maps of the Netherlands at province and municipality level of 2013. The used projection is the Rijksdriehoekstelsel projection. \strong{Important:} publication of these maps is only allowed when cited to Statistics Netherlands (CBS) and Kadaster Nederland as source.

#' tmap element
#'
#' Building block to draw thematic maps.
#' 
#' The only fundamental, and hence required element is
#' \itemize{
#' \item \code{\link{tm_shape}} that specifies the shape object, and also controls the projection and bounding box}
#' 
#' The elements that serve as drawing layers are
#' \itemize{
#' \item \code{\link{tm_borders}} to draw polygon borders
#' \item \code{\link{tm_fill}} to color the polygons
#' \item \code{\link{tm_bubbles}} to draw bubbles
#' \item \code{\link{tm_lines}} to draw lines}
#' 
#' The layers can be stacked by simply adding them with the + symbol. The combination of the elements described above form one group. Multiple groups can be stacked. Each group should start with \code{\link{tm_shape}}.
#' 
#' The layout elements are
#' \itemize{
#' \item \code{\link{tm_layout}} to change the appearance of the map, for instance titles and legend positions. Predefined themes for the example shape files are \code{\link{tm_layout_World}}, \code{\link{tm_layout_Europe}}, and \code{\link{tm_layout_NLD}}.
#' \item \code{\link{tm_facets}} that specifies how small multiples are created, i.e. how many rows and colums, and whether the statistical data variables have free scales or not.
#' \item \code{\link{tm_grid}} that specifies grid lines
