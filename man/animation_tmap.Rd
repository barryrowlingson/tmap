\usage{
animation_tmap(expr, width = 1000, height = 1000, delay = 40,
  filename = "animation.gif")
}
\arguments{
\item{expr}{R expression to create series of tmap plots. In order to create a series of tmap plots, which will be the frames of the animation, it is important to set nrow and ncol in \code{\link{tm_facets}}, for otherwise a small multiples plot is generated. Commonly, where one map is shown at a time, both nrow and ncol are set to 1.}

\item{width}{width of the animation file (in pixels)}

\item{height}{height of the animation file (in pixels)}

\item{delay}{delay time between images (in 1/100th of a second)}

\item{filename}{filename of the video (should be a .gif or .mpg file)}
}
\description{
