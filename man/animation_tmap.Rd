In order to create a series of plots, which are combined to an animation, it is important to set nrow and ncol in \code{\link{tm_facets}} such that nrow * ncol < [number of small multiples]. In most situations, where one map is shown, both nrow and ncol are set to 1.}

\item{width}{width of the animation file (in pixels)}

\item{height}{height of the animation file (in pixels)}

\item{delay}{delay time between images}

\item{filename}{filename of the video (should be a .gif or .mpg file)}
