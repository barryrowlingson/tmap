\title{Crop shape objects}
\usage{
crop_shape(shp, bbox = shp@bbox, set.bbox = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{shp}{shape object, which is one of
\enumerate{
 \item{\code{\link[sp:SpatialPolygonsDataFrame]{SpatialPolygons(DataFrame)}}}
 \item{\code{\link[sp:SpatialPointsDataFrame]{SpatialPoints(DataFrame)}}}
 \item{\code{\link[sp:SpatialLinesDataFrame]{SpatialLines(DataFrame)}}}
}}

\item{bbox}{rectangle to crop the \code{shp} with. It is represented by a 2x2 matrix in which the x and y coordiantes are respectively row 1 and 2, and the minimum and maximum values are respectively column 1 and 2. By default the bounding box of \code{shp} is taken.}

\item{set.bbox}{logical that determines whether the bounding box of \code{shp} is set to \code{bbox}. If \code{FALSE}, the bounding box is determined by \code{shp} after cropping.}
}
\value{
A cropped shape object. Its bounding box is set to \code{bb}. Data is retained in case \code{shp} has data. A vector of matched ID's is stored as a attribute \code{matchID}. This vector contains for each polygon in the returned shape object the number of its orignal polygon in \code{shp}.
}
\description{
Crop a shape object to a rectangle which is by default its bounding box.
