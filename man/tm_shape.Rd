\usage{
tm_shape(shp, is.master = NA, projection = NULL, xlim = NULL,
  ylim = NULL, relative = FALSE, bbox = NULL, unit = "km",
  unit.size = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{shp}{shape object, which is one of
\enumerate{
 \item{\code{\link[sp:SpatialPolygonsDataFrame]{SpatialPolygons(DataFrame)}}}
 \item{\code{\link[sp:SpatialPointsDataFrame]{SpatialPoints(DataFrame)}}}
 \item{\code{\link[sp:SpatialLinesDataFrame]{SpatialLines(DataFrame)}}}
 \item{\code{\link[sp:SpatialGridDataFrame]{SpatialGrid(DataFrame)}}}
 \item{\code{\link[sp:SpatialPixelsDataFrame]{SpatialPixels(DataFrame)}}}
 \item{\code{\link[raster:Raster-class]{RasterLayer, RasterStack, or RasterBrick}}}
}
For drawing layers \code{\link{tm_fill}} and \code{\link{tm_borders}}, 1 is required. For drawing layer \code{\link{tm_lines}}, 3 is required. Layers \code{\link{tm_bubbles}} and \code{\link{tm_text}} accept 1 to 3. For layer \code{\link{tm_raster}}, 4, 5, or 6 is required.}

\item{is.master}{logical that determines whether this \code{tm_shape} is the master shape element. The bounding box, projection settings, and the unit specifications of the resulting thematic map are taken from the \code{tm_shape} element of the master shape object. By default, the first master shape element with a raster shape is the master, and if there are no raster shapes used, then the first \code{tm_shape} is the master shape element.}

\item{projection}{character that determines the projection. Either a \code{PROJ.4} character string or one of the following shortcuts:
\describe{
       \item{\code{"longlat"}}{Not really a projection, but a plot of the longitude-latitude coordinates (WGS84 datum).}
       \item{\code{"wintri"}}{Winkel Tripel (1921). Popular projection that is useful in world maps. It is the standard of world maps made by the National Geographic Society. Type: compromise}
       \item{\code{"robin"}}{Robinson (1963). Another popular projection for world maps. Type: compromise}
       \item{\code{"eck4"}}{Eckert IV (1906). Projection useful for world maps. Area sizes are preserved, which makes it particularly useful for truthful choropleths. Type: equal-area}
       \item{\code{"hd"}}{Hobo-Dyer (2002). Another projection useful for world maps in which area sizes are preserved. Type: equal-area}
       \item{\code{"gall"}}{Gall (Peters) (1855). Another projection useful for world maps in which area sizes are preserved. Type: equal-area}
       \item{\code{"merc"}}{Mercator (1569). Projection in which shapes are locally preserved. However, areas close to the poles are inflated. Google Maps uses a close variant of the Mercator. Type: conformal}
       \item{\code{"utmXX(s)"}}{Universal Transverse Mercator. Set of 60 projections where each projection is a traverse mercator optimized for a 6 degree longitude range. These ranges are called UTM zones. Zone \code{01} covers -180 to -174 degrees (West) and zone \code{60} 174 to 180 east. Replace XX in the character string with the zone number. For southern hemisphere, add \code{"s"}. So, for instance, the Netherlands is \code{"utm31"} and New Zealand is \code{"utm59s"}}
       \item{\code{"mill"}}{Miller (1942). Projetion based on Mercator, in which poles are displayed. Type: compromise}
       \item{\code{"eqc0"}}{Equirectangular (120). Projection in which distances along meridians are conserved. The equator is the standard parallel. Also known as Plate Carr\'ee. Type: equidistant}
       \item{\code{"eqc30"}}{Equirectangular (120). Projection in which distances along meridians are conserved. The latitude of 30 is the standard parallel. Type: equidistant}
       \item{\code{"eqc45"}}{Equirectangular (120). Projection in which distances along meridians are conserved. The latitude of 45 is the standard parallel. Also known as Gall isographic. Type: equidistant}
       \item{\code{"rd"}}{Rijksdriehoekstelsel. Triangulation coordinate system used in the Netherlands.}}
       See \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_map_projections} for a overview of projections.
       See \url{http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/} for the \code{PROJ.4} project home page. An extensive list of \code{PROJ.4} codes can be created with rgdal's \code{\link[rgdal:make_EPSG]{make_EPSG}}.
       By default, the projection is used that is defined in the \code{shp} object itself, which can be obtained with \code{\link{get_projection}}.}

\item{xlim}{limits of the x-axis. These are either absolute or relative (depending on the argument \code{relative}). Alternatively, the argument \code{bbox} can be set to set absolute values.}

\item{ylim}{limits of the y-axis. See \code{xlim}.}

\item{relative}{boolean that determines whether relative values are used for \code{xlim} and \code{ylim} or absolute.}

\item{bbox}{bounding box, which is a 2x2 matrix that consists absolute \code{xlim} and \code{ylim} values. If specified, it overrides both \code{xlim} and \code{ylim}.}

\item{unit}{unit specification. Needed when calculating density values in choropleth maps (argument \code{convert2density} in \code{\link{tm_fill}}) drawing a scale bar with \code{\link{tm_scale_bar}}. See also \code{unit.size}.}

\item{unit.size}{size of the unit in terms of coordinate units. The coordinate system of many projections is approximately in meters while thematic maps typically range many kilometers, so by default \code{unit="km"} and \code{unit.size=1000} (meaning 1 kilometer equals 1000 coordinate units).}

\code{\link{tmap-element}}
}
\description{
Creates a \code{\link{tmap-element}} that specifies the shape object. Also the projection and covered area (bounding box) can be set. It is possible to use multiple shape objects within one plot (see \code{\link{tmap-element}}).
