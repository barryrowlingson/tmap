\description{
Building block to draw thematic maps.
}
\details{
The only fundamental, and hence required element is
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{tm_shape}} that specifies the shape object, and also controls the projection and bounding box}

The elements that serve as drawing layers are
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{tm_borders}} to draw polygon borders
\item \code{\link{tm_fill}} to color the polygons
\item \code{\link{tm_bubbles}} to draw bubbles
\item \code{\link{tm_lines}} to draw lines}

The layers can be stacked by simply adding them with the + symbol. The combination of the elements described above form one group. Multiple groups can be stacked. Each group should start with \code{\link{tm_shape}}.

The layout elements are
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{tm_layout}} to change the appearance of the map, for instance titles and legend positions. Predefined themes for the example shape files are \code{\link{tm_layout_World}}, \code{\link{tm_layout_Europe}}, and \code{\link{tm_layout_NLD}}.
\item \code{\link{tm_facets}} that specifies how small multiples are created, i.e. how many rows and colums, and whether the statistical data variables have free scales or not.
\item \code{\link{tm_grid}} that specifies grid lines
}
}
