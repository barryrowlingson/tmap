\usage{
read_shape(file, current.projection = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{a shape file name (including directory)}

\item{current.projection}{the current projection of the shape object, if it is missing in the shape file. It should be either a \code{PROJ.4} character string (see \url{http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/}), of one of the following shortcuts:
\describe{
       \item{\code{"longlat"}}{Not really a projection, but a plot of the longitude-latitude coordinates (WGS84 datum).}
       \item{\code{"wintri"}}{Winkel Tripel (1921). Popular projection that is useful in world maps. It is the standard of world maps made by the National Geographic Society. Type: compromise}
       \item{\code{"robin"}}{Robinson (1963). Another popular projection for world maps. Type: compromise}
       \item{\code{"eck4"}}{Eckert IV (1906). Projection useful for world maps. Area sizes are preserved, which makes it particularly useful for truthful choropleths. Type: equal-area}
       \item{\code{"hd"}}{Hobo-Dyer (2002). Another projection useful for world maps in which area sizes are preserved. Type: equal-area}
       \item{\code{"gall"}}{Gall (Peters) (1855). Another projection useful for world maps in which area sizes are preserved. Type: equal-area}
       \item{\code{"merc"}}{Mercator (1569). Projection in which shapes are locally preserved. However, areas close to the poles are inflated. Google Maps uses a close variant of the Mercator. Type: conformal}
       \item{\code{"utmXX(s)"}}{Universal Transverse Mercator. Set of 60 projections where each projection is a traverse mercator optimized for a 6 degree longitude range. These ranges are called UTM zones. Zone \code{01} covers -180 to -174 degrees (West) and zone \code{60} 174 to 180 east. Replace XX in the character string with the zone number. For southern hemisphere, add \code{"s"}. So, for instance, the Netherlands is \code{"utm31"} and New Zealand is \code{"utm59s"}}
       \item{\code{"mill"}}{Miller (1942). Projetion based on Mercator, in which poles are displayed. Type: compromise}
       \item{\code{"eqc0"}}{Equirectangular (120). Projection in which distances along meridians are conserved. The equator is the standard parallel. Also known as Plate Carr\'ee. Type: equidistant}
       \item{\code{"eqc30"}}{Equirectangular (120). Projection in which distances along meridians are conserved. The latitude of 30 is the standard parallel. Type: equidistant}
       \item{\code{"eqc45"}}{Equirectangular (120). Projection in which distances along meridians are conserved. The latitude of 45 is the standard parallel. Also known as Gall isographic. Type: equidistant}
       \item{\code{"rd"}}{Rijksdriehoekstelsel. Triangulation coordinate system used in the Netherlands.}}
       See \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_map_projections} for a overview of projections.
Use \code{\link{set_projection}} to reproject the shape object.}

\item{...}{other parameters, such as \code{stringsAsFactors}, are passed on to \code{\link[rgdal:readOGR]{readOGR}}}
}
\value{
shape object
}
\description{
Read an ESRI shape file. Optionally, set the current projection if it is missing.
}
\details{
This function is a convenient wrapper of rgdal's \code{\link[rgdal:readOGR]{readOGR}}. It is possible to set the current projection, if it is undefined in the shape file. If a reprojection is required, use \code{\link{set_projection}}.

For the Netherlands: often, the Dutch Rijksdriehoekstelsel (Dutch National Grid) projection is provided in the shape file without proper datum shift parameters to wgs84. This functions automatically adds these parameters. See \url{http://www.qgis.nl/2011/12/05/epsg28992-of-rijksdriehoekstelsel-verschuiving/} (in Dutch) for details.
