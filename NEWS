version 1.0
- added tm_credits and tm_scale_bar
- added is.master argument to tm_shape, that determines which shape is the master
- added unit and unit.size arguments to tm_shape that correlates the coordinates with the desired units
- added tm_polygons, which is a combination of tm_fill and tm_borders
- fixed several small bugs

version 0.8
- added tm_raster
- improved legend behaviour: legend titles should be set in the layer functions (instead of in tm_layout)
- removed crop_shape, since raster::crop does the same job, but, but faster
- out-of-scope functions migrated to spatialToolbox package, available on github.com/mtennekes/spatialToolbox

version 0.7.1
- fixed big in scale parameter (global scale set in tm_layout)

version 0.7
- enhanced small multiples (tm_facets) with respect to scaling and free coordinate scales 
- added alpha argument to tm layers for transparency
- added text shadow argument
- added function split to split a shape object and sbind to combine shape objects.
- added automatic legend positioning when legend.position=NULL
- improved number formatting in legend
- improved inner.margins and outer.margins. Both can take one value (e.g. outer.margins=0 rather than outer.margins=c(0,0,0,0))
- improved qtm: tm_facets parameters working, and also fixed scale parameter bug
- improved all examples for approx_areas, calc_densities
- fixed bug regarding drawing a frame with outer.margins=0. 
- fixed bug in plotting blubbles
- improved temp file handling in animation_tmap
- added functions to get and set polygon directions, and to calculate the intersection ratios of polygons (intersection_shapes)

version 0.6
- this is the the first CRAN version
- a newer version may be available on https://github.com/mtennekes/tmap
